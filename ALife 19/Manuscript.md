## Abstract

The basis for formal game theory involves interactions between players whom possess a set of strategies that are deployed rationally. Purely rational deployment contributes to the formation of dynamic equilibria. In many cases involving human behavior, however, we have players who come from non-overlapping sets of cultural assumptions. We might be tempted to discount this variation as noise or as a factor to be incorporated into a traditional decision-making model. In this paper, we will introduce the concept of ideological game theory. Ideological game theory removes the limiting assumptions of both rationality and optimality. The main assumption involves that humans employ strategies which are empirically-based, epistemically-based, or a mixture of each (blended strategy). We will discuss the philosophical roots of this assumption, provide a generalized model of ideological games, examine a series of examples applied to existing game theory models, and then discuss the potential outcomes in terms of Dempster-Shafer theory.
