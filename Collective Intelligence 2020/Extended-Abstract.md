How do we represent diversity omnipresent in the natural world to a population of interacting, behavior-producing agents? We propose using a hybrid genetic/connectionist model to represent the internal model of individual agents. Internal models not only interact with the internal model of other agents, but can also synthesize different sources of information embodied in environmental stimuli. Stimulus diversity is achieved introducing stimuli from various perspectives. These are generally a single object with invariant structure presented as different objects subject to a number of mathematical transformations.
