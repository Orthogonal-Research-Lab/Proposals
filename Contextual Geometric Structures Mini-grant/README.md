# Artificial Intelligence Using Contextual Geometric Structures  

### Very Short Project Summary:  
Contextual Geometric Structures (CGS) simulate the structural and cognitive aspects of human culture and the context it provides.

### Project Summary:  
Contextual Geometric Structures (CGS) are an alternative approach to modeling intelligent behavior. This is done by representing both the structural and cognitive aspects of human culture. We can use this approach in two ways: 1) to enrich our understanding of general intelligence by providing a link between the empirical and contextual worlds, and 2) as an approximation of the cultural influences on intelligent behavior.

While we can utilize the CGS approach to test hypotheses, the most informative use it in adding a cultural layer onto general intelligence. Rather than building a generative model that emits seemingly intelligent behaviors, the CGS approach relies on kernels operating on a multidimensional concept space. Each concept space is a description of higher-level concepts (e.g. death) built from dimensions representing simpler phenomena (e.g. light-dark, hot-cold). While the full extent of the space represents the natural (physiochemical) ontology of concept classes, we can nevertheless define subspaces that determine the phenomenology of specific cultural representations. All possible cultural representations can thus be contained inside a single concept space. Their overlap and independence provide information about the abilities of different cultural traditions to generalize with respect to the empirical world. However, unlike a general intelligence, cultures within a CGS would provide semantic context and intersubjective understanding within a problem domain.

I developed this idea over a decade while studying cultural evolution, evolutionary computation, and artificial intelligence. While there are a number of mathematical models for cultural evolution and evolutionary artificial intelligence, there is currently no model in the AI literature that deals with culture front and center as a component of intelligence. While currently developed as a set of mathematical models and pseudo-code, I envision CGS programs as a means to approximate and predict phenomena in human behavior not easily explicable by rational decision-making models. CGS agents and populations of agents could be particularly useful as a tool for human-machine interaction, particularly during interactions where deep meaning is useful in facilitating communication. This grant would allow me to focus a bit more time onto the project, and advance the more technical aspects of the project.

### What would this grant help to accomplish:  
Devote time to developing this idea into something that might have commercial value. As an independent researcher, I have an interest in applying otherwise abstract concepts to practical problems. While the original intent of working on this idea was to solve a challenging problem, a longer-term goal is to develop a technically-rigorous platform. This grant would assist in meeting this longer-term goal.

### What will this grant allow you to do?   
Transform the symbolic models and hand-coded elements that currently exist into executable code, and perhaps result in a real-world application.
