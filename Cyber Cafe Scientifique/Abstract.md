## Distributed, Collaborative Science

Dr. Bradly Alicea along with members of the Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory will present a session on how to build and manage a distributed, collaborative research organization. Orthogonal Lab, an entirely virtual entity, is managed using an open-source ethos. Academic contributions, collaborative efforts, and informal discussions are conducted using technologies often used in open-source communities. This allows us to collaborate across a large number of time zones, and manage projects with a minimum of overhead. We also take advantage of this distributed structure to engage in research across a wide variety of traditional disciplines. Whereas a University environment would be limiting in the nature of inquiry, Orthogonal Lab engages in a freer flow of ideas, ranging from Developmental Biology to Computational Neuroscience. We also collaborate with larger efforts such as Neuromatch Academy to enhance the educational experience.
