## Periodicity in the embryo: emergence of order in space, diffusion of order in time.  
### Bradly Alicea and Richard Gordon  

While the case for the effects of "tempo and mode" [1] have been made for the evolutionary process, a similar relationship between phenotypic change and time may also exist in development. One obvious answer to this question is to examine the expression and sequence variation of genes associated with the cell cycle [2]. However, there is a potentially more compelling top-down explanation. We will use two model organisms to demonstrate how periodicity becomes less synchronized over developmental time. In the case of the nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_, a comparison of embryogenetic and postembryonic cells (developmental and terminally-differentiated cell birth times acquired from [3]) reveals two general patterns. For the Zebrafish (_Danio rerio_), comparisons within and between embryogenetic stages based on measurements of cell nuclei in the animal hemisphere [4] reveal patterns at multiple scales. Based on these findings, we predict that periodic changes in the frequency of new cells over developmental time represents cell proliferation without functional distinction. Aperiodic changes in cell birth frequency will represent a diversity of specialized sublineages and functionally-specific cell births. We will apply frequency-analysis techniques to refine the distinction between periodic and aperiodic time periods. To determine whether aperiodicity represents meaningful information or noise, we can use the information isometry technique [5] to visualize the effects of increasing temporal and sublineage variation. This set of analyses will hopefully provide potential macro-level explanations for the coordination of cell division in addition to uncovering potential precursor events and mechanisms related to differentiation.
