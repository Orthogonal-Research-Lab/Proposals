## Periodicity in the embryo: emergence of order in space, diffusion of order in time.  
### Bradly Alicea and Richard Gordon

While the case for the effects of "tempo and mode" [1] have been made for evolution, a similar relatinship between organismal biology and time may lso exist in development. We will use two model organisms to demonstrate how periodicity becomes less synchronized over developmental time. In the case of the nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_, comparisons are between developmental and terminally-differentiated cell birth times retrieved from [2]. A comparison of embryogenetic and postembryonic cell birth times reveals two general patterns. For the zebrafish (_Danio rerio_), comparisons are within and between embryogenetic stages based on measurements of cell nuclei in the animal hemisphere [3].


It may be that increasing aperiodicity may be due to an increase in the number of cells during development. However, this increasing aperiodicity may also be due to specialization of sublineages across the lineage tree. To examine this question, we can use the information isometry technique [4] to visualize the effects of increasing temporal variation.
