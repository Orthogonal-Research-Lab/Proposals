## Periodicity in the embryo: emergence of order in space, diffusion of order in time.  
### Bradly Alicea and Richard Gordon

We will use two model organisms to demonstrate how periodicity becomes less synchronized over developmental time. In the case of the nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_, comparisons will be made between developmental and terminally-differentiated cell birth times. In the case of zebrafish (_Danio rerio_), comparisons will be made within and between embryogenetic stages.
