### GSoC Project: Modeling Neural Development with Braitenberg Vehicles

**Description:** Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory is seeking to further develop the [Representational Brains and Phenotypes](https://representational-brains-phenotypes.weebly.com/) project by building scientific simualtions for deployment in basic research and educational outreach. We aim to construct a dynamical simulation involving several types of [Braitenberg vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle) as described by Valentino Braitenberg in his classic book "Vehicles: experiments in synthetic Psychology" (1984).


**Aims:**  These simulations will involve building a virtual model of a vehicle, complete with the body, sensors, effectors, and internal neural wiring. Simulating changes in the wiring based on environmental stimuli and bodily constraints is the most important part of the model, as we seek to go beyond Braitenberg's original vision and incorporate the construction of highly complex nervous systems (neuronal networks).  


**Skills:** open source development experience with C++, Python, Java. An interest in the underlying biological processes is essential, and applicants with strong abstract thinking abilities are preferred. Good communication skills and familiarity with open science practices are expected.
