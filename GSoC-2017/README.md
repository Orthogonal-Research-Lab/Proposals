## Contextual Geometric Representations of Cultural Behavior  

**Description:** Contextual Geometric Structures (CGSs) are an alternative approach to modeling intelligent behavior, and represent both structural and neurocognitive aspects of human culture. 

We can use the CGS approach in two ways: 

1) to enrich our understanding of general intelligence by providing a link between the neural processing, empirical observation, and contextual worlds.  

2) as an approximation of the cultural influences on intelligent behavior. While we can utilize the CGS approach to test hypotheses, the most informative use it in adding a cultural layer onto general intelligence.  

The model consists of an _n_-dimensional space that define the phenomenology of specific cultural representations, and a connectionist network that provides a link to the empirical world. Populations of agents representing a wide range of distinct cultural representations can thus be contained inside a single concept space. Their overlap and independence provide information about the abilities of different cultural traditions to generalize with respect to the empirical world. CGS agents and populations of agents could be particularly useful as a tool for human-machine interaction, particularly during interactions where deep meaning is useful in facilitating communication.

**Aims:** Goals for the coding period will be formalized in collaboration with the student, but includes several outstanding issues: 1) transform symbolic models and higher-level representations into executable code, 2) creating test scenarios for two test problems (biodiversity and culturomics), 3) establish an analytical framework for performance metrics.

While currently developed as a set of mathematical and geometrical models, a long-term vision for CGS programs includes a means to approximate and predict phenomena in human behavior not easily explicable by rational decision-making models. For more information (conference presentation and technical papers), please see the following CGS project summaries: Project site on OSF Commons which includes [papers and presentations](https://osf.io/ynffr/) and [Explainer Videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Odu9LMo1kY&list=PL4RJ4xCetB62KEKyVsyOo3pYTabvVCRVg).

**Skills:** Open source development experience with languages such as C++, Python. An interest in the underlying biological processes is essential, and applicants with strong abstract thinking abilities are preferred. Good communication skills and familiarity with open science practices are expected.
