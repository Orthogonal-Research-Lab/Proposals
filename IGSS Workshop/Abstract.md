Agent-based models present a sophistication challenge on the part of an agent’s behavior. While agent-based models can produce behavioral complexity without a complex brain, models that simulate animal behavior are nevertheless assumed to do so with a brain. At the same time, Artificial Intelligence presents a similar challenge involving representational complexity: while minimal representations can produce behavioral outputs like locomotion or simple decision-making, more elaborate internal representations might offer a richer variety of behaviors. While Artificial Intelligence is more concerned with individual behaviors, the consequences of rich behavioral repertoires and flexible internal models has consequences for constructing more realistic and informative agent-based models. 

We propose that these issues can be addressed with a computational approach we call meta-brain models. Meta-brain models are hybrid models of  Artificial Intelligence that include layered components of varying degrees of representational complexity. Rather than taking a conventional neural network or deep learning approach, layering in a meta-brain is instead inspired by biological neuroanatomy. To demonstrate this, we propose a two-layer meta-brain consisting of one representation-free (standard connectionist model) and one representation-rich (analogical system) component. We will propose combinations of layers composed using specialized types of models. Rather than using a generic black box approach to unify each component, this relationship mimics systems like the neocortical-thalamic system relationship of the mammalian brain, which utilizes both feedforward and feedback connectivity to facilitate functional communication. Importantly, the relationship between layers can be made anatomically explicit. For example, the representation-rich component can "encase" or be "layered" on top of the representation-free component. This allows for structural specificity that can be incorporated into the model’s function in interesting ways.

We further propose that the meta-brained agent architecture can be utilized in agent-based models of self-organized and population-level phenomena, as well as social behaviors. In this talk, we will introduce several model systems to demonstrate this compatibility, including chemical morphogenesis, the ethnocentrism game (Schelling’s segregation model), and flocking/swarming. The application of meta-brain models to specific systems also allows us to consider how developmental and evolutionary approaches might be used to build our layered heterogeneous representations in a specific environmental context. Of particular interest is the dynamic behavior of connections between each layer along with the establishment of new layers.

The meta-brains project currently involves three aims: creating models with different degrees of representational complexity, creating a layered meta-architecture that mimics the structural and functional heterogeneity of biological brains, and an input/output methodology that is flexible enough to accommodate behavioral and social phenomena alike. We will conclude by proposing next steps in the development of this flexible and open-source approach.
