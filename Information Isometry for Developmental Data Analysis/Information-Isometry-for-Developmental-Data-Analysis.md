### Information Isometry for Developmental Data Analysis

In comparative studies, it is important not only to have information about similarities and differences between taxa, but also to quantify these relationships in a systematic manner. Computer vision techniques combined with high-resolution microscopy provide a source of data for the proposed an analytical and theoretical framework. In this talk, I will introduce a method called information isometry [1], which allows us to characterize structural and functional changes as information. Structural and functional aspects of the comparison are also capturable using a representational approach, using isometric geometry to visualize relationships among cell populations between pairwise taxa. We will review two examples: how isometric bivariate graphs can represent differences between developmental cell lineages, and how complex phenotypes map to texture mappings [2]. The first of these involves a second-order analysis of the developmental lineage tree. Specifically, we can represent and measure the structural and state differences between a pair of cell lineage trees using a bivariate isometric graph. Alternately, a similar type of second-order analysis leads to the representation of spatial and molecular properties of homologous cell populations in an isometric graphical pattern. These patterns form networks that resemble topologies similar those found in the art of M.C. Escher or classic video games such as Sim City and Zaxxon [3]. In this latter case, pairwise comparisons of complex neural phenotypes occur in the form of relational data structures [4]. To capture the information content in these structures, we will propose using either Hamming distance for static comparisons, or Kullback-Leibler divergence for dynamic comparisons. Information Isometry provides a means to reduce four dimensions of information (three of space, one of time) and intriguing natural relationships such as strange loops [5] to an easily representable 2-D data structure.
