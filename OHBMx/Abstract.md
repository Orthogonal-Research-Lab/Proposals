## Developmental Braitenberg Vehicles (dBVs): developmental neuroethology in a computer 

Neuroethology is the study of brain and behavior in the context of an animalâ€™s natural environment [1]. In behavioral simulations, this naturalism can be approximated through interdependencies among brain, body, and environment. Our approach is particularly interesting to brain scientists as simulated environments allow for environmental and neurological components of a naturalistic interaction to be both specified and controlled. We will use a type of Braitenberg Vehicle [2] called Developmental Braitenberg Vehicles (dBVs) to model the developmental aspects of an embodied artificial nervous system. Developmental BVs will generate behaviors that range from phototropisms and sensorimotor coordination to more complex behaviors that resemble an emotional response. Our presentation will preview a forthcoming paper from our group on the topic [3]. To do this, we will briefly discuss three approaches to dBVs in software that demonstrate how a BV-genetic algorithm hybrid model, multisensory Hebbian learning model, and multi-agent (dBV collective) approaches can be used to approach BV development. These software approaches can be used to study diverse behavioral contexts such as optimized spatial cognition (vehicle-genetic algorithm hybrid model), hinges connecting behavioral and neural models (multisensory Hebbian learning model), and cumulative classification (multi-agent approaches).
