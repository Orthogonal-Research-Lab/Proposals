## Developmental Braitenberg Vehicles (dBVs): developmental neuroethology in a computer 

Neuroethology is the study of brain and behavior in the context of an animal’s natural environment [1]. In behavioral simulations, this naturalism can be approximated through interdependencies among brain, body, and environment. Our approach is particularly interesting to brain scientists because simulated environments allow for both the environmental and neurological components of a naturalistic interaction to be both specified and controlled. We will use a type of Braitenberg Vehicle [2] called Developmental Braitenberg Vehicles (dBVs) to model the developmental aspects of an embodied artificial nervous system. Developmental BV will generate behaviors that include both classic BV behaviors and basic perceptual actions. Our presentation will preview a forthcoming paper from our group on the topic [3]. To do this, we will briefly discuss three approaches to dBVs in software that demonstrate how a BV-genetic algorithm hybrid model, multisensory Hebbian learning model, and multi-agent (dBV collective) approaches can be used to approach BV development. We will also demonstrate how these different software approaches can be used to study diverse behavioral contexts such as optimized spatial cognition (vehicle-genetic algorithm hybrid model), hinges connecting behavioral and neural models (multisensory Hebbian learning model), and cumulative classification (multi-agent approaches).
