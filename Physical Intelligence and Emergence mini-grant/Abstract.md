## Experientially Coherent Agents: using physical intelligence to understand universal coherence
 
Consciousness is a form of natural computing, and can be elucidated through psychophysical stimuli and computational agent engaged in  emergent information processing. To create an experimental system that explores physical information processing, I propose to create an agent-based model that represents information processing as selection upon pattern formation. This will hopefully result in a model of universal coherence, a subgoal of and necessary step towards understanding physical consciousness.

### Potential framework
To understand universal coherence, we propose to study something called physical intelligence among computational agents. Physical intelligence generation relies on an illusory system of stimuli presented to computational agents, which possess both a perceptual interface and an internal model. Agents sample a complex illusion-generating system using a series of subjective viewpoints through which information can be integrated using the internal model. 

### Moire patters as a morphogenetic form of intelligence
Moire patterns provide a rich environment in terms of both pattern-based information and unique perspectives. The coordinated movements of simple physical gratings provide a physical stimulus to our agent population, the internal states of which are driven by discrete spatiotemporal sampling. Moire patterns also create interference patterns that force multiple geometric perspectives to be reconciled. Within an agent’s internal model, stimulus integration allows for a representation to form via morphogenetic processes. In this sense, our stimulus bridges the gap between classical and quantum physical phenomena. The processing of these patterns do not require a brain per se, and part of these experiment will involve investigating representations that provide the best performance in terms of sustained attention and information processing.

### Other Types of Systems
Moire patterns are only one type of stimulus system that can be used in such experiments. Another possible system involves the use of isometric geometries, in particular non-transitive exemplified by Penrose Stairs or M.C. Escher’s “Relativity”. This example provides another way to exploit the relativistic representational capacity of our agents, and can also be synthesized in a morphogenetic fashion.

### Agents and their operation
Physical consciousness requires a form of physical attention that guides intentional behavior. Attentional mechanisms develop as a meta-function of the morphogenetic representation. Two types of mathematical operation are achieved via attentional function: "integrate", and "adjacency". These result from the attention engine synthesizing and normalizing information. When these processes break down, we expect to see some form of sensory displacement. In terms of output behaviors, we expect two modes of operation from these attentional machines.

One mode involves something called emergent attention, which can be driven by emergent behavior or energetics (feedback from a global profile of fluctuations). Another mode involves coordinated displacement, which is similar to attention disruption in animal brains, and occurs due to breaks in attention or visual illusions.

### Informative Outputs
Any potential role for consciousness will relies upon three properties of physical intelligence. This can be though of as three types of mathematical operation: "displace", "track", and "sample". Sensory displacement can be defined as a representation-environment match. Sensory tracking involves spatiotemporal continuity, and planning and sampling can be defined in terms of frequencies at which new information is acquired from the environment.
