## Informationally Coherent Agents: using physical intelligence to understand universal coherence
 
Consciousness in physical systems can be elucidated by appealing to both psychophysics and the function of simple physical systems. Consciousness is also a form of natural computing. The goal is to create a representational system of intelligence that is computationally equivalent conditions found in the physical world. To create an experimental system that explores information processing in physical systems, I propose to create a system of agents that process complex physical phenomena and represents this as behavioral fitness and communication with other agents. This will hopefully result in a model of  universal coherence, a subgoal of and necessary step towards understanding physical consciousness.

### Potential framework
To lay the groundwork for understanding consciousness in non-biological systems, we propose to study something called physical intelligence in a computational system. This can be done by creating an illusory system for a population of agents, each with a perceptual interface and an internal model. Each agent samples a complex illusion-generating system using a series of subjective viewpoints through which they can integrate information using their internal model. 

### Moire patters as a morphogenetic form of intelligence
Moire patterns provide a rich environment in terms of both pattern-based information and unique perspectives. The expression of Moire patterns by the movements of simple physical gratings provide a physical stimulus to our agent population, the internal states of which are driven by discrete spatiotemporal sampling of this environment. Moire patterns also create interference patterns that force multiple geometric perspectives to be reconciled. Within an agent’s internal model, integration of the stimulus allows for a representation to form via morphogenetic processes. In this sense, our stimulus bridges the gap between classical and quantum physical phenomena. The processing of these patterns do not require a brain per se, and part of these experiment will involve investigating representations that provide the best performance in terms of sustained attention and information processing.

### Other Types of Systems
Moire patterns are only one type of stimulus system that can be used in such experiments. Another possible system involves the use of isometric geometries, in particular non-transitive exemplified by Penrose Stairs or M.C. Escher’s “Relativity”. This example provides another way to exploit the relativistic representational capacity of our agents, and can also be synthesized in a morphogenetic fashion.

### Agents and their operation
Physical consciousness requires a form of physical attention, attentional mechanisms that guide intentional behavior. Thus, our agents consist of attentional machines that can focus on particular aspects of an experience and integrate those components in a way that creates an experience. There are two types of mathematical operation that can be achieved by the agents themselves: "integrate", and "adjacency". These are used by the attention engine as strategies for synthesizing and normalizing information. When these processes break down, we expect to see some form of sensory displacement. In terms of output behaviors, we expect two modes of operation from these attentional machines.

One mode involves something called emergent attention, which can be driven by emergent behavior or energetics (feedback from a global profile of fluctuations). Another mode involves coordinated displacement, which is similar to attention disruption in animal brains, and occurs due to breaks in attention or visual illusions.

### Informative Outputs
Any potential role for consciousness will relies upon three properties of physical intelligence. This can be though of as three types of mathematical operation: "displace", "track", and "sample". Sensory displacement can be defined as a representation-environment match. Sensory tracking involves spatiotemporal continuity, and planning and sampling can be defined in terms of frequencies at which new information is acquired from the environment.
