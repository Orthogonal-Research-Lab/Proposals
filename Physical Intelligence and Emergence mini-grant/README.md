## Thought-pad for Physical Intelligence and Emergence, FQXi "Consciousness in the Physical World" full grant.

Initial application due on February 12th RFP. Proposal should include the following:

300 - 500 word summary of the project, explicitly addressing the role of physical laws, consciousness, and conscious agents in the physical world.

draft budget with description not exceeding 200 words, including an approximate total cost over the life of the award and explanation of how funds would be spent.  

Curriculum Vitae for each Principal Investigator, including: 1) education and employment history, 2) list of up to ﬁve previous publications relevant to the proposed research and ﬁve additional representative publications, 3) full publication list.

highest allowed overhead rate is 15%.

average award size: $100K, 1-2 years in length. Half-time or less award. Outreach-oriented awards typically smaller.

Inspire investigations into the many connections between basic physical laws and the nature of intelligence and intelligent agents.

part-time work (15% to 40%), in parallel with the scientist's usual research.  

### Potential framework:  

Three main themes -- "sample", "displace", "track".  

Two additional themes -- "integrate", "adjacency"

Assume physical reality is not a simulation, but rather a flow field. The flow field notion is a sort of perceptual aether, but is also consistent with optical flow from roobtics. Awareness is aligned with the flow field most of the time, but can be misaligned to produce breaks in reality.  

* aether is a spatial representation, mimics what brains do.  

* physical consciousness requires a form of physical attention, attentional mechanisms that guide intentional behavior.

* collective attention can be driven by emergent behavior or energetics (feedback from a global profile of fluctuations).

* "displace" is related to disruption in animal brains (breaks in attention, consciousness).

### 3 main forms of Physical Intelligence:  

1) sensory displacement (representation-environment match).  

2) sensory tracking (spatiotemporal continuity).  

3) planning and sampling (frequency, new information, refresh rate).  

Population of cells: adaptive learning system, is this something that requires a brain?  

* can be broken apart in a virtual environment (or synthetic systems such as an artificial cell).  


### One possible implementation: Moire patters as a morphgenetic form of intelligence

See notes here [link](https://github.com/devoworm/AoDT/blob/master/Moire%20Patterns%20for%20Developmental%20Data/README.md)

Moire patterns can do all three of these if coupled to an intelligent agent.

* Moire pattern creates interference, virtual world for agent, which co-evolves with shifting of patterns.

* expression of Moire pattern and adaptation of agent neural net is a coevolutionary relationship.
