## Thought-pad for Physical Intelligence and Emergence, FQXi "Consciousness in the Physical World" full grant.

Initial application due on February 12th RFP. Proposal should include the following:

300 - 500 word summary of the project, explicitly addressing the role of physical laws, consciousness, and conscious agents in the physical world.

draft budget with description not exceeding 200 words, including an approximate total cost over the life of the award and explanation of how funds would be spent.  

Curriculum Vitae for each Principal Investigator, including: 1) education and employment history, 2) list of up to ﬁve previous publications relevant to the proposed research and ﬁve additional representative publications, 3) full publication list.

highest allowed overhead rate is 15%.

average award size: $100K, 1-2 years in length. Half-time or less award. Outreach-oriented awards typically smaller.

Inspire investigations into the many connections between basic physical laws and the nature of intelligence and intelligent agents.

part-time work (15% to 40%), in parallel with the scientist's usual research.  



### Potential framework:  

To lay the groundwork for understanding consciousness in non-biological systems, we propose to study something called physical intelligence in a computational system. Create an illusory system with agents. Each agent samples illusory system (Moire pattern formation) using a series of subjective viewpoints through which they can intergrate information. 


### One possible implementation: Moire patters as a morphgenetic form of intelligence

See notes here [link](https://github.com/devoworm/AoDT/blob/master/Moire%20Patterns%20for%20Developmental%20Data/README.md)

Moire patterns can do all three of these if coupled to an intelligent agent.

* Moire pattern creates interference, virtual world for agent, which co-evolves with shifting of patterns.

* expression of Moire pattern and adaptation of agent neural net is a coevolutionary relationship.

Awareness is aligned with the flow field most of the time, but can be misaligned >>>> to produce breaks in reality. Aether is a spatial representation, mimics what brains do.  


### Agents and their operation  

Physical consciousness requires a form of physical attention, attentional mechanisms that guide intentional behavior. Thus, our agents consist of attentional machines that can focus on particular aspects of an experience and integrate those components in a way that creates an experience. There are two types of mathematical operation that can be achieved by the agents themselves: "integrate", and "adjacency". These are used by the attention engine as strategies for synthesizing and normalizing information. When these processes break down, we expect to see some form of sensory displacement. In terms of output behaviors, we expect two modes of operation from these attentional machines.

1) emergent attention, which can be driven by emergent behavior or energetics (feedback from a global profile of fluctuations).

2) coordinated displacement, which is related to disruption in animal brains, and occur due to breaks in attention or visual illusions.


### Informative Outputs  

Physical consciousness also relies upon three properties of physical intelligence. This can be though of as three types of mathematical operation: "displace", "track", and "sample".  

1) sensory displacement (representation-environment match).  

2) sensory tracking (spatiotemporal continuity).  

3) planning and sampling (frequency, new information, refresh rate).
