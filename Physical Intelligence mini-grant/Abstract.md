Towards an Understanding and Theory of Physical Intelligence

While it is well-known that biological processes both produce information, it is unclear how such processes respond to being embedded in a larger physical environment. At the same time, global information processing appears tp operate at many scales and whether or not a formal nervous system exists. In liue of ascribing a general intelligence mechanism to these phenomena, I propose a more specific set of mechanisms collectively defined as physical intelligence (PI). This theory of intelligence is of great topical value, and is applicable to domains such as biological development, percpetion, and biomechanics. This theory is flexible enough to operate both as a metaphor and in a more explicit form. PI is also a foundational theory that merges the phenomenology and principles of motion with that of connectivity. It is these two mechanisms which work together to create a form of intelligence from physical inputs. While intelligence is typically defined in terms of vision, learning, or language, PI provides an unconventional view of adaptive intelligent behavior. Even in the area of brainless cognition, where information processing occurs without neuronal communication, the mechanism for collective intelligence is unclear.  

The core prediction of PI is that physical constraints and experience observed by a network of sensory information exists in a stable equilibrium state. When the context of this information is altered, the system in question will adjust in an adaptive manner. We predict that this is widespread in biological systems, and should produce a number of surprising behaviors. Thus, PI is an emergent property of complex systems with three main mechanisms: connectivity, adjacency, and constraints.  

1) connectivity: interactions between individual units. Interactivity between individual units and environment.  

2) adjacency: patterns of connectivity important. How long is the path between x and y? What is the adjacent possible for any position in the network?  

3) constraints: connectivity dead-ends, regions of connectivity that are too sparse (signal loss) or too dense (signal noise), geometric barriers.  

This project will focus on empirical investigation and theoretical synthesis in two model systems: human perception and artificial developmental systems. In the first case, myself and a community of collaborators would develop Virtual Reality (VR) and Tangible User Interface (TUI) platforms to test how physical intelligence might operate in human nervous systems. As a comparison, we also plan to examine the underpinnings of PI in artificial developmental systems.
