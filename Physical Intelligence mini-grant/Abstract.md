Topicality: This theory of intelligence is applicable to developmental, percpetual, and cosmological domains. Physical Intelligence is flexible enough to operate both as a metaphor and in a more explicit form.  

Foundational: This is a theory that merges the phenomenology and principles of motion with that of connectivity. It is these two mechanisms which work together to create a form of intelligence from physical inputs.  

Unconventional: Intelligence is typically defined in terms of vision, learning, or language. Even in the area of brainless
cognition, where information processing occurs without neuronal communication, the mechanism for collective intelligence is unclear.  



Intelligence is an emergent property of complex systems; three main mechanisms: connectivity, adjacency, and constraints.  

1) connectivity: interactions between individual units. Interactivity between individual units and environment.  

2) adjacency: patterns of connectivity important. How long is the path between x and y? What is the adjacent possible for any position in the network?  

3) constraints: connectivity dead-ends, regions of connectivity that are too sparse (signal loss) or too dense (signal noise), geometric barriers.
