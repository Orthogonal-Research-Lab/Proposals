Thought-pad for Physical Intelligence, [FQXi "Intelligence in the Physical World"](https://fqxi.org/grants/large/initial) full grant.  

Initial application due on February 11th [RFP](https://fqxi.org/data/documents/2018-Request-for-Proposals.pdf). Proposal should include the following:  

* 300 - 500 word summary of the project, explicitly addressing why it is topical, foundational and unconventional.  

Topicality: This theory of intelligence is applicable to developmental, percpetual, and cosmological domains. Physical Intelligence is flexible enough to operate both as a metaphor and in a more explicit form.  

Foundational: This is a theory that merges the phenomenology and principles of motion with that of connectivity. It is these two mechanisms which work together to create a form of intelligence from physical inputs.  

Unconventional: Intelligence is typically defined in terms of vision, learning, or language. Even in the area of brainless
cognition, where information processing occurs without neuronal communication, the mechanism for collective intelligence is unclear.  


* draft budget with description not exceeding 200 words, including an approximate total cost over the life of the award and explanation of how funds would be spent.  

* Curriculum Vitae for each Principal Investigator, including: 1) education and employment history, 2) list of up to ﬁve previous publications relevant to the proposed research and ﬁve additional representative publications, 3) full publication list.  

* highest allowed overhead rate is 15%.  

* average award size: $100K, 1-2 years in length. Half-time or less award. Outreach-oriented awards typically smaller.  

Inspire investigations into the many connections between basic physical laws and the nature of intelligence and intelligent agents.   

* part-time work (15% to 40%), in parallel with the scientist's usual research.  

* precursor call: Agency in the Physical World -- [RFP](https://fqxi.org/grants/large/awardees/list/2018).  

Potential Questions:  
How does the physical world shape intelligence (cognition) and intelligent-like processes (embryogenesis)? 


A Theory of Physical Intelligence (PI):  

Intelligence is an emergent property of complex systems; three main mechanisms: connectivity, adjacency, and constraints.  

1) connectivity: interactions between individual units. Interactivity between individual units and environment.  

2) adjacency: patterns of connectivity important. How long is the path between x and y? What is the adjacent possible for any position in the network?  

3) constraints: connectivity dead-ends, regions of connectivity that are too sparse (signal loss) or too dense (signal noise), geometric barriers.  

Proprioceptive/Haptic function as a metaphor:  

* engage with physical environment of forces and resistances.  

* create a model of space-time based on physical movements (moments of position -- from first to higher-order moments).  

* physical movement and resistances are represented in this model of space-time.  

* physical forces are mapped to shape of network -- representation is malleable, but so is environment.  

* virtual environment can be used to modify physical-sensry mapping, break physical laws, or provide unexpected inputs.  

Components:  

* tangible user interface (TUI), artificial life model, virtual environment (_n_-D models).  

* money for TUI, simulation, interface design, technology budget, salary, education/outreach component.   

* software will be made open, and executable from a Docker container.
