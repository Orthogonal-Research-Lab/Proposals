Thought-pad for Physical Intelligence, [FQXi "Intelligence in the Physical World"](https://fqxi.org/grants/large/initial) full grant.  

Initial application due on February 11th [RFP](https://fqxi.org/data/documents/2018-Request-for-Proposals.pdf). Proposal should include the following:  

* 300 - 500 word summary of the project, explicitly addressing why it is topical, foundational and unconventional.  

* draft budget with description not exceeding 200 words, including an approximate total cost over the life of the award and explanation of how funds would be spent.  

* Curriculum Vitae for each Principal Investigator, including: 1) education and employment history, 2) list of up to ﬁve previous publications relevant to the proposed research and ﬁve additional representative publications, 3) full publication list.  

* highest allowed overhead rate is 15%.  

* average award size: $100K, 1-2 years in length. Half-time or less award. Outreach-oriented awards typically smaller.  

Inspire investigations into the many connections between basic physical laws and the nature of intelligence and intelligent agents.   

* part-time work (15% to 40%), in parallel with the scientist's usual research.  

* precursor call: Agency in the Physical World -- [RFP](https://fqxi.org/grants/large/awardees/list/2018).  


Potential Questions:  
How does the physical world shape intelligence (cognition) and intelligent-like processes (embryogenesis)? 


A Theory of Physical Intelligence (PI):  


Proprioceptive/Haptic function as a metaphor:  

* engage with physical environment of forces and resistances.  

* create a model of space-time based on physical movements (moments of position -- from first to higher-order moments).  

* physical movement and resistances are represented in this model of space-time.  

* physical forces are mapped to shape of network -- representation is malleable, but so is environment.  

* virtual environment can be used to modify physical-sensry mapping, break physical laws, or provide unexpected inputs.  

Measurement:

* fold-change/intensity: a way to measure information and noise.  

Components:  

* tangible user interface (TUI), artificial life model, virtual environment (_n_-D models).  

* money for TUI, simulation, interface design, technology budget, salary, education/outreach component.   

* software will be made open, and executable from a Docker container.
