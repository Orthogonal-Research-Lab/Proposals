Virtual environments give us the opportunity to probe perception and action in ways that are not readily available in everyday life. One of the most exciting aspects of behavior in virtual worlds are the naturalistic introduction of perceptual illusions. Forms of visual and haptic accomodation such as the prism adaptation [1] or the cutaneous rabbit [2] can be explored either seperately or in tandem in a controlled manner. This leads to a set of behaviors and cognitive effects called _virtuality_.
