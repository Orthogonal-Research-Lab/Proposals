Virtual environments give us the opportunity to probe perception and action in ways that are not readily available in everyday life. One of the most exciting aspects of behavior in virtual worlds are the naturalistic introduction of perceptual gaps, or misalignments of the sensorimotor loop. Forms of visual and haptic accomodation such as the prism adaptation [1] or the cutaneous rabbit [2] can be explored either seperately or in tandem in a controlled manner. This leads to a set of behaviors and cognitive effects called _virtuality_, which can be mapped to a brain network that represents a set of cognitive functions [3]. Virtuality can be used as the basis of a cognitive agent that exhibits a number of these cognitive gaps, collectively defined as physical intelligence. Our agents have five basic functions: two attentional (integrate and adjacnecy) and three sensorimotor (diplace, track, and sample).
