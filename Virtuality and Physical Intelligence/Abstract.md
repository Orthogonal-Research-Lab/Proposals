Virtual environments give us the opportunity to probe perception and action in ways that are not readily available in everyday life. One of the most surprising aspects of behavior in virtual worlds are cognitive gaps. Cognitive gaps result from the controlled introduction of latencies and deformations in otherwise naturalistic settings, and have surprising implications for brain and behavior. These cognitive gaps come in three flavors: misalignments of the sensorimotor loop, changes in the timing of sensory accomodation, and the disarticulation of multisensory integration. This leads to a set of cognitive effects called _virtuality_, which can be mapped to a brain network representing a diverse group of functional areas. Virtuality can be explored further through the use of computational agents. Our agent's sole imperative is to experience and overcome cognitive gaps, the ability to do so leads to the exhibition of something we define as physical intelligence. Physical intelligence emerges from five basic cognitive functions: two attentional (integrate and adjacency) and three sensorimotor (displace, track, and sample). In this talk, we will explore the architcture of these agents, some preliminary experiments, and implications for our understanding of the development and evolution of animal cognition. 



### NOTES:
Experimentally, it has been shown that forms of visual and haptic accomodation such as the prism adaptation [1] or the cutaneous rabbit [2] can be explored either seperately or in tandem in a controlled manner.
